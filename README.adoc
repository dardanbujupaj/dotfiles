== TODO

[ ] install-script
[ ] links to used tools

== Installation
To install a dotfile create a symlink at its expected location to the actual file in the repository.

 cd dotfiles
 ln -s .zshrc ~/.zshrc

== Notes
=== .zshrc
==== nvm
nvm is loaded by .zshrc.
If the .nvm folder does not exist in the $HOME directory, nvm will not be loaded.
Install nvm with:

 curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install | bash

Check https://github.com/creationix/nvm for the latest version.


=== .vimrc
vim plugins are installed via Vundle. To use the .vimrc-dotfile, install Vundle like this:

 git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
